The goal of ideacolors is simple: to ensure that IDEA R&A graphics generated in `R` with `ggplot2` conform to [IDEA's Brand Guidelines](https://ideapublicschoolsorg.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/MCE/Shared%20Documents/Creative%20Resources,%20Logos,%20and%20Mascots/Brand%20Guidelines/branding_brand_guidelines_10x10_2019.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=SfZG79) by providing themes and scales. It uses the palette defined in the Brand Guidelines document found on pages 21-22. 

The point is to help us innovate on the content of our visualizations rather than the look and feel. Indeed, the latter is important in conveying analysis and insights in a familiar way, but it remains more sizzle than steak. 

## Installation

Since this is an internal package, you need to install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("idea-analytics/ideacolors")
```
## Examples

Here we can use `scale_idea_colors` and `theme_idea_light`

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(ideacolors)

library(tidyverse)

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=disp, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=as_factor(cyl))) +
  scale_color_idea(palette = "div") +
  theme_idea_light()
  
p
```

And we can change it up with a qualitative color scale and  `theme_idea_min`:
```{r example_2, warning=FALSE}
p + 
  scale_color_idea(palette = "qual") +
  theme_idea_min()
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
